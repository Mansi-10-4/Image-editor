# Mini Project

## Steps to Run the Image Editor

1. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install gradio pillow rembg numpy
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd c:\Users\Mansi Patel\python_project\Mini project\Task-1
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    Execute the Python script to start the Gradio interface:
    ```bash
    python app3.py
    ```

4. **Open the Interface**:
    Once the script is running, it will provide you with a local URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`). Open this URL in your web browser to access the image editor interface.

5. **Use the Image Editor**:
    - Upload an image.
    - Use the provided options to flip, rotate, convert to black and white, resize, adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, remove background, and choose the image format.
    - View the processed image and download it if desired.

6. **Flagging**:
    If you encounter any issues or want to flag an image, the flagged images will be saved in the `flagged` directory.

## Additional Information

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection as Gradio might need to download some resources.
- The processed images will be saved in the same directory as the script with the name `processed_image.<format>`.
